# DevOps End To End Project
DevOps End to End Project using Google Cloud, Terraform

# Steps
## 1. Create GH Repo
Firstly will start with creating the GH Repo say "DevOps_End_To_End_Project".
While creating the repo, make sure to add "README" file and optionally add gitignore file, for this I am adding w.r.t Terraform.

## 2. Personal Access Token
Personal access tokens are an alternative to using passwords for authentication to GitHub when using the GitHub API or the command line. Personal access tokens are intended to access GitHub resources on behalf of yourself.

### How to Generate a Personal Access Token
Creating Personal Access Tokens in GitHub is straightforward:

1. Click your portfolio button on any page in GitHub, then press the Settings button.
2. Navigate to `Developer Settings` > `Personal access tokens` > `Tokens (classic)`.
3. On the screen that loads, click the Generate new token button, give your token a name, and configure the expiration period for the token.
4. Configure which scopes to assign to the token. Basically, they are the specific types of permissions that the token should allow a user to perform.
5. When the configuration process is complete, click the Generate token button to activate your new token.
